Alex Â - great to hear your voice ss it were! I hope you are doing well. Iâ€™ve listened to most of the Syntax podcast and read the blog post. Brilliant stuff! Maybe I missed something but I wondered if they had tooling to automate parts of the porting process. And Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re wondering Mark, why not write everything in Go in the first place and skip TypeScript altogetherÂ ![ðŸ™‚](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f642/32.png)

  

The big hit on HTMX - and I heard this from the Syntax guys - is that sure it is super simple but you run out of runway very quickly on even modestly complex projects. I read the fixi docs and thought the same. I donâ€™t know why Lit didnâ€™t get more traction ss it is tiny too but much more capable.

One of the hopes I hold is that now that there's another world class compiler team using Go

(one with a different perspective on useability, and language idioms)

that this may have a beneficial influence on the evolution of Go.

Hi both, 

Great to be in on the chat around the history of Go and the new TypeScript developments!

Yes, we're doing really well over here thanks Mark! Family life is very fun, if a little chaotic at times! :) Hope all is good with you over there too. 

I think i'd read that Adobe is using Lit for their web version of Photoshop. V cool.
