# BP Static: Sprint 2


Break the project down and make project boards for css and bsk? Not sure we need 2 boards tbh. 

Add tasks to the 1 project board then.

CSS: 
Need to bring everything over and have all the dir structure sorted.
Test.
Just use BS 5.1 for now: update packages as needed.

JS: 
Sort out if we are using BSK or Vue.
If we're using BSK, do everything downstream of that.

## Notes

### issues: 

- What to do about fallback values if we use this 'reactive' attr to load data? 
- What 

Do we need prepare reactive? Only if its loads of data. Otherwise just using teh stanard way we load stuff is prop better? 
The reactive as a way to load stuff still might have value?
