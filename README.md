# wiki
My Personal Wiki.

A test space for housing all of my writing i want to share with others.

The basic idea is to keep using Simplenote for rough drafts and private notes, and use this wiki for anything more polished and public.

I have wanted to write a log for some time but i'm not sure what the focus should be. Rather than try and pre-empt that i thought i'd just focus on getting beyond unshared messy notes to more concrete and shareable writing The rest will figure itself out after i have got further with the actual writing itself.
