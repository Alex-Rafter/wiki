My Personal Wiki

A test space for housing all of my writing that i want to share with others.

I have wanted to write a blog for some time but i've not been sure what the focus should be. Rather than try and pre-empt that i thought i'd just focus on actually writing and publishing. The rest will figure itself out after i have got further with the actual writing itself i'm sure.

The basic idea is to keep using Simplenote for rough drafts and private notes, and use this wiki for anything more polished and / or public.
