Just a quick update on the beta test of UAT deploy at PR open, and git revert on PR closed.

  

I think we have a really nice workflow now with this.

This def helps keep UAT up to date with all changes where these were getting missed before at times; and it reduces the extra clickup step as the time-save we wanted.

A couple of things :

  

- There is a way to keep UAT history much much closer to main at all times - which i think would help improve UAT's role as a true staging branch. Â Would like to discuss the idea for this and get feedback.

- There are lots of options to build in some automated testing on the staging branch - eg the workflow firing off a bunch of requests to key pages on UAT after deploy, and checking status codes, to make sure pages aren't erroring after the changes etc. Status of the tests could then be added to the PR body as a mini report for dev / reviewer.

- There is a question to answer about how this new worfklow would work at build as we may want to deploy to uat on push still or there are a few other options too.
