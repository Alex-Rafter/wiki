## Agenda

## matts question on jermyn components readyness

- Tom has caught up with Matt on current build and seeing speed improvements.
- Matt asking qs on jermyn number bsk-els that can be used on build.
- About 80% of home in component lib.
- Issue of larger library.

### How to create a component library

- Discussed system for creating a component library from build dev's work.

### bsk-els notes

- Mon offers cards breaking due to content not as expected at build.
- How do we stop these kind of issues?
- Do we need to clarify use-cases for each component with Projects / CS Docs?
  - can we 80/20 these so main sections are covered in docs.

## kates process questions from yesterday (assessing) and prio's

- Kate msg on bsk-els chat re: process.
- Do we need the assessment step?
- Tension between building and docs / team support etc.

### Process :
- Kate submits in the channel what is prio and we flag it that way

## 300 sites idea
Main things :
  - limiting techical overhead
    - How much we have to do to set up and customise
    - Ongoing maintenance - errors and bug fixes
      - what is the mechanism for solving in one place and rolling out to all sites
      - Standardisation : completely templated - no customisation
      - Separate click up spaces, separate cogcms instance, etc
      - Forms and cognition as configuration data, which is used in automation of site creation
  - Ideal set up :
    - Goal standard would be fully automated site creation : http request on form submission -> git clones template and creates a site.
    - Templated sites 1,2,3 - something this high-level? Or page-level choices.
    - Easy as poss to spin up and make, and error fix.

## build dev catch ups review notes and actions

- Gone over dev feedback from devs
- Issue with no proper franchise set up
- Planning and build review meets as the best time to do this catch up

### Action :
- Schedule before and after
-
