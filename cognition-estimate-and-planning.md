# Cognition Estimate and Planning

## Goal :
- Customised version of BS ui library with updated util classes that can be used in fe dev work but that also enables tech to work easily with pre-established design tokens while working Agile methodology
- style guide components : either base BS components (re)styled and applicable via markup and css classes, or built out and provided as static html snippets with css / css utils
- components :

  1. Login page inc 2FA
  2. vehicle uploader inc all states with js eg drag and drop etc
  3. Dashboard
  does this include configure dashboard? No dedicated design for this?

## Plan :
Design -> Static HTML -> Razor Pages

- Focus on static html build out of components first, and delivering customised variables and util classes
- A focus from design and FE on setting up things like the customised variables and util classes etc so that iteration can be done easily within the design constraints
- These then handed over for integration into the Razor pages / partials

## Deliverables :
- Static html build out of components
- Customised Bootstrap and BS util classes with docs where needed
- JS with import maps for use as is or for integration with build tool if needed in future

## Time Estimate : 2 weeks
Discussed that this is a rough estimate, as the process is quite different from normal build. Plan discussed with Lauren is to review at end of week 1 on progress, and clarify what will be achievable by end of week 2 / end of this first phase.
