# Cognition Estimate and Planning

Goal :
- customised version of BS ui library with updated util classes that can be used in fe dev work but that also enables tech to work easily with pre-established design tokens while working Agile methodology
- style guide compontents : either base bs els styled and applicable via classes, or built out and provided as static html snippets
- components
vehicle uploader component in all states with js eg drag and drop etc
Dashboard
does this include configue dashboard? No dedicated design for this?

Design -> Static HTML -> Razor Pages

- Focus on static html build out of components first
- A focus from design and FE on setting up things like the customised variables and util classes etc so that iteration can be done easily within the design constraints
- These then handed over for integration into the Razor pages / partials
