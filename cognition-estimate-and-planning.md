# Cognition Estimate and Planning

## Plan :
Design -> Static HTML -> Razor Pages
- Components as static html, along with util classes, etc handed over for integration into the Razor pages / partials
<br>
*(see prev notes)[https://github.com/Alex-Rafter/wiki/blob/main/new-cognition-fe-dev-work.md]

## Deliverables :

- Customised Bootstrap and BS util classes
  - any docs where needed eg custom spacings etc
- Styleguide component styles

- Static html build out of Cognition components

  1. Login page inc 2FA
  2. vehicle uploader inc all states with js eg drag and drop etc
  3. Dashboard
  does this include configure dashboard? No dedicated design for this?

- JS with import maps for use as is or for integration with build tool if needed in future

## Time Estimate : 2 weeks
Discussed that this is a rough estimate, as the process is quite different from normal build. Plan discussed with Lauren is to for us to review at end of week 1 on progress, and clarify what will be achievable by end of week 2 / end of this first phase.
