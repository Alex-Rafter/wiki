# Cognition Estimate and Planning

Goal :
- Customised version of BS ui library with updated util classes that can be used in fe dev work but that also enables tech to work easily with pre-established design tokens while working Agile methodology
- style guide components : either base BS components (re)styled and applicable via markup and css classes, or built out and provided as static html snippets with css / css utils
- components

  1. Login page inc 2FA
  2. vehicle uploader inc all states with js eg drag and drop etc
  3. Dashboard
  does this include configue dashboard? No dedicated design for this?


Plan :
Design -> Static HTML -> Razor Pages

Deliverrables :

- Static html build out of components first, handed over for integration into the Razor pages / partials as test of this process
- Customised Bootstrap and BS util classes with docs where needed
- JS with impirt maps for use as is or easy intergration into FE build too if used in future
