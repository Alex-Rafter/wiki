# Web Scraping Brief - Draft

## Problem :
Adobe XD does not provide an easy way to export css rules from components. We are limited to having to manually copy and paste after clicking on each component which is slow. XD does provide an list of css rules for easy export but it is limited to a small number of those used in the design. We need the full set of rules associated with all of the components.


## Overall Aim :

The aim of the work is to create an automated solution that can either scrape an xd link or otherwise interact with the ui of the adobe xd link to pull out the css rules of each component, and then create a json file containing all of the css rules broken down by each component / sub-component. It will also need to include the css rules that adobe xd does provide a list of, mentioned above.

This solution needs to be usable on an ongoing basis with the designs we produce in XD.

### Example

Here is an example of how a component from the xd link would look. In this example, the component is broken down by XD into two clickable areas that when clicked produce css rule sets. That can be copied and pasted.

#### JSON

Here is an example of the sort of result that we would like to have in json format from the above component :

```json
{
  "Standard part exchange section with CTA": [
    {
      "top": "416px;",
      "left": "0px;",
      "width": "744px;",
      "height": "443px;",
      "background": "transparent url('img/AdobeStock_242320137.png') 0% 0% no-repeat padding-box;",
      "opacity": "1;"
    },
    {
      "Layout Properties": {
        "top": "416px;",
        "left": "0px;",
        "width": "1920px;",
        "height": "443px;"
      },
      "UI Properties": {
        "background": "var(---ffffff) 0% 0% no-repeat padding-box;",
        "border": "1px solid var(---border-color);",
        "background": "#FFFFFF 0% 0% no-repeat padding-box;",
        "border": "1px solid #CFCFCF;",
        "opacity": "1;"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
