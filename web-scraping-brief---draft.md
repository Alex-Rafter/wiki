# Web Scraping Brief - Draft

## Problem :
Adode XD does not provide an easy way to export css rules from components. We are limited to having to manually copy and paste after clicking on each component which is slow and manual. XD does provide an list of css rules for easy export but it is limited to a small number of those used in teh design. We need the full set of rules assocated with the components.


## Overall Aim :

The aim of the work is to create an automated solution that can either scrape an xd link or otherwise interact with the ui of the adbode xd link to pull out the css rules of each component, and then create a json file containing all of the css rules broken down by each component / sub-component. It will also need to include the css rules that adobe xd does provide a list of mentioned abovre.

This solution needs to be usable on an ongoing basis with the designs we produce in XD.
