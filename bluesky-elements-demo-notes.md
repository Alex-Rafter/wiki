Bluesky Elements is our own in-house component library built using
- custom html elements,
- template tags,
- and Petite Vue.

https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue

### Aims

Some of the core aims for the library are :

- to maximise re-usability of our code
- save time on building, extending and maintaining sites
- to optimise design to dev workflow including building a shared language for component namings
- Flexibility and customisation within each component
- Complex and/or time-consuming logic or styles (e.g header navs, js widgets etc) can been created, tested, and iterated on, and we all will have access to our best collective work inside these off-the-shelf components.
