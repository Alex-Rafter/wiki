# Meet With Barbs


## Built Time

- Data fetch 
- Data load 
- Validation
- Normalisation
- 
- BSK Data
- BSK Transform

- property maps for query 
- Demo server rendered

## Client Side
- Dispatch Store + Dispatch Worker
- Unified API - property maps and query object
- Pipe / transform
- Omni search component set - make a quick search off
- filters
- pagination
- toggles
- looping over items


## Next steps 


### Stage 3 
Working group - who? Can we set now : 

#### Graded approach Static -> Dynamic -> Client Side
We validate the idea that FE Devs can build with the new codebase as quickly as possible.

cut scope and deliver static assets first with gradual intro
increase complexity and difficulty 
work to Natre of Software Dev - iterations 1  /2 weeks.

validating the idea : codebase improves Dev ex, speed and quality
learning by shipping - in a graded way 
We're following the principle of iterations - finished code in main branch as what constitutes 'done'.


#### Codebase : 
cont work on omni-search set 
bring overs from bsk 
copilot intergration


Learning the codebase 
Learning the process of how we work while working the stages up to ready to produce sites 
Validating ideas early 
Move immediately out of our comfort zone and ship 
Work through graded approach to learning the codebase 
Do so by focusing on relative strengths - and in doing so we start people off with something both fun and impactful
