Second thing. We are running the first tests of BP Static alpha with another FE Dev. Natalia will be testing building some static assets with the new codebase.

Iteratiomn Goal:
- Validate quickly that others can build with BP Static successfully
- Get valuable feedback on the Developer Experience (DX) at this stage of the codebase's development.
- Start a new collection of UI features that leverage the new features built into BP Static - particularly gsap

Sprint Qs: 
- (main) Can a others in the FE Team successfully build with BP Static at this stage?
- Where are the rough edges? 
- What is missing that's needed to make it easy for FE devs to work with BP Static?
- What kind of assets can we quickly build that leverage BP Static inc GSAP? How quickly can we produce these?
