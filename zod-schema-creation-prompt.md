Create a zod schema for the data in the files below.

The files should be a .js file. They should follow the examples in src\_lib\config\schemas directory with regards to : 
- importing z from astro, 
- using named exports not default exports. The export syntax should come at the end of the file not at variable declaration. 
- file name related to content type and location to file from which schema is created - eg pages.js, banner.js, etc
  
For an example of a successfully created schema file see: src\_lib\config\schemas\pages.js
