## Catch up with Barbs

Points: 
1. Natalia update 
2. BP Static - my workflow update 
3. LLM / tooling implications 

Natalia update 

BP Static - my workflow update 
	lost time
	differences since start of the week (considerably faster)
	making vs mentoring Natalia 
	new tooling an opps its opening up - Since Tues


1 week versus 1 morning - discuss drafting workflow and implications
Lots of work downstream on this with slicing and refactoring 
potential to automate this also. 

Suggestions sort to med
keep Natalia on with bring overs (useful and helps her get up to speed)
BP Static - what we need to get to ready to build - 2 x 2 sprints 
*What kind of ready does that look like?*


med to long
implications of new workflows 
what is automatable now? what's does that mean for us?
