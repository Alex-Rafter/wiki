Today is about components pure and simple. Its about DND all day and getting a load of shit done. New shit. Cool shit. Shit i can show off and be proud of at the end of the day. Before i do any of that though i need to clear down the windsors task.


- [x] Windsors motab (group)
- [ ] UCD gallery intergrate both and set attr controls.

What do i need to do?
- [ ] Intergrate templates into 1
    Diff again and set up so class bindings are done with is="full-width"

- [ ] Intergrate js into 1
    set up 2 init functions for standard and full width
    call these based on value if full-width attr
    Just stick all the slick stuff in these first with dups, the filter down

- [ ] why choose us spots
- [ ] Opening hours

Amends
- [ ] slider banner mob styles
- [ ] vehicle card list for slider
- [ ] use stretch link on cards (offers?)
