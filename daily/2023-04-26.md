### Form Filter Fix

Problem - it doesn't match concept. To natch concpet we need proxy fields.
Caffyns uses something similar.

- Create a static version of the filters - accordions etc with the correct markup
- get the fields populkating based on what is in the real form
- get the real form inputs / selects etc to update based on the actions on the proxy fields / checkboxes
