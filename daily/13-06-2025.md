normal dropdown
mega-menu dropdown option

footer
covering all commonly covered fields 

creative hero section
data - should map on to cms banners fields 
should handle multiple banners content - whether through carousel like behaviour or creative grid layout
should utilise gsap for animations / transitions

cta section
based on existing bp component


spots: 
data - should map on to either 
cms pages / pages for list data points
