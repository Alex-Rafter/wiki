First day back after holidays

Need to clarify a bit what i am doing next and put together a proper plan for that. 

What are we trying to do? What is the main thing? 

The main goal is getting a version of BP Static done and ready to demo for end of Sept.
There is a lot to do for that.

I need a solid breakdown of everything i am trying to do. With milestones, and have these on a board. 
I should work backwards from the end goal and plan out stuff. 
But isn't that going to be waterfall? 
Well, i can plan out features and organise them by value, and then prio the next one from there?

End goal: 

- A fully working MVP BP Static that we can build a site with.

What it needs?
- Every key page type should be boilerplated with dynamic data.
- We need basic CI/CD in place for deployment workflows.
- The codebase needs to be well organised, tidy, and ready for others to use
- Documentation needs to be comprehensive and easy to use.

We also need a list of hard problems and things not covered by the point.

Milestones
a demo of all pages for next meeting

What is the workflow for creating these templates key pages?
Use Claude code to knock out the key pages what we don't have designs for
Refactor these
