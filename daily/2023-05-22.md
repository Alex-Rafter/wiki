Today is all about bsk-els and the clickup workflow. The goal for the week at a min is to ship a fully tested and battle-ready header component. This is a big job! Possibly as big as the vehicle cards.
Its about collaboration with Matt : clarifying workflow, work, process, prios, etc
Ideally, Matt and i attack that one component until done. We split it by sub-task : top nav, header, nav, and work separately.

## Tasks
- Review CW API
