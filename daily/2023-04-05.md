## Notes

### Meetign with Kate
Design :  https://xd.adobe.com/view/ae691825-dd27-4699-9809-6abcc17231ce-fb3a/

#### Typography :
margin - just bottom or margin all?
use rem not em
line height
match the main bs type vars

$headings-margin-bottom:      $spacer * .5 !default;
$headings-font-family:        $xd-custom-title-font;
$headings-font-style:         null !default;
$headings-font-weight:        600;
$headings-line-height:        1.2 !default;
$headings-color:              null !defau

expliict font sizes and font family
*issue with line-height on wessex at 1.8

#### Spacing
Wessex 10px not small enough for lowest spacing level - can we make sure we have one smaller than this on the scale
Are buttons matched to this spacing scale?

#### Borer radius
Can we have 3 sizes to match bs + if we are using pill or not
$border-radius:               $xd-border-radius;
$border-radius-sm:            calc($xd-border-radius / 2);
$border-radius-lg:            calc($xd-border-radius * 1.5);
$border-radius-pill:          50rem !default;

#### Components
pages 1 -5 - no content?

#### Btn group
vertical variation looks a bit out?

### Side notes
icons to script - pull out for js inport and css import for use in stylesheets
