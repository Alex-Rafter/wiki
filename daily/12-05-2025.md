Start of Sprint 3

Already written quite a bit about it. The most important thing is to get what i've started already finished and prod ready / ready to bring other developers on board with.

plan and go

bsk-data-be - 1 day
bsk-data-fe - 2 days
docs - 2 days

1 week remaining. Do review Fri and plan for final week.


## bsk-data-be

methods on every object
getSection or getSummary

getSummary()
always return an object 
properties depend on the collection type

getOne()
always returns an object

getMany()
always returns an array of objects

Dont fit: 
banners
Vehicle?

banners: 
what needs to happen to make this work?

well, first off its probably best to split into 
bannerFolders and banners

banners: 
should be an array of all banners. 
It would be better to do this at the data fetch and store phase - so all match as we'd expect here 



banner folders can be as it its now - that collection. But it should be an object with an array of banners as a property of that. This then will match the others more closely



then run getOne, gteMany on each and query as we do with anything else 
create a top level property for this id or folder name so that we can query by that with banner folders
