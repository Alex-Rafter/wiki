## Sinc Perf 

Quick update from me: 
- We have 3 sets of changes live on Sinc now thanks to Mabbs jumping on testing Fri 
- We're making progress but imo testing burden is a bottleneck for getting changes live
- So far we have 3 parts of the initial work (that was reverted on live) deployed and live but we still have at least 1 more (possibly 2) chunks of this work to deploy just to get us back to where we were after the initial go live on 16th
- The initial work needs finishing before i can then get on to the second batch that's required to get us close to a finished piece of work. Using smaller commits like we have here, i estimate there will be 3 more sets of changes to test and deploy in this 2nd part of the work. 
- After we finish those we can start to look at measuring changes to finish off report 
- I am scheduled on new world codebase from today. As we need to factor in the testing time for each set of perf changes, i plan to keep doing work in batches: as each of prev set is tested and deployed on live i'll add another change ready for testing. Hopefully this will mean we can get a flow of testing and deploying work this week that works for everyone.
- Based on what we've got live so far, and schedule for this week, it's going to take some time (maybe end of the week?) to get this up to a point where we can feed back with meaningful improvements to the client.


Global JS Changes

Change 4 - Global JS Changes
The changes here include: 
changing the order in which scripts fire / deferring external scripts
fixing error prone inline scripts
removing dead code

What do we need to testing?
These changes are global and so we need to spot test across the site to make sure: 
Do scripts still fire / work as on live? 
Do plugins still work as on live? 
Does UVD still work as it does on live? tabs, accodions, plugins etc?
Do features and specs etc still work they do on live?
