What do i need to get done today? 
I need to get the data load stuff prod ready. Thats my big outstanding code related task.
Sorting out the HTMX vs Petite stuff is a good thing to get nailed down before the end of the sprint. 

HTMX vs BSK / HTML vs JSON endpoints.

HTMX offers lots of promise. The simplicuty of the API is great. But the lack of any server means all the logic has to run on the client - and that means its pretty hampered in terms of power (unless i add additional FE scripting for filtering the data retuned). For this reason, if i have to choose just one type of data to return its JSON. Shame in a way.

I have to have JSON endpoints (or hacky FE filtering of the HTML etc).
HTML endpoints are a nice to have comparatively.
