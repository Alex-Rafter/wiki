Today i want to ship some useful stuff that helps make builds faster. Somethign good to show after a not great week, where i've worked pretty hard but teh solutions haven't ended up working as well as i'd hoped. I want to turn that around today.

## Tasks

- [ ] Wessex filters solution
  - [ ] Can i make this simpler?
- [ ] BP refactor basics done and ready to show.
    Harder stuff - defer for a round 2 wherever possible
    SL speedy search - defer?

## Notes

### Wessex filters solution
Can i make this simpler?
What does it actually need to do?
On init it :
- gets the values and state of the real form fields
- creates a new proxy form field for each one of these with the correct input type
- matches the state of the proxy fields to the real fields
- adds a listener to each proxy field that updates the corresponding real field when it changes
