Today is about :
Getting the docs done and in to vitepress format ready for a PR. I will need to collate them all and check them all. I need to check why i'm getting errors with dev set up of the docs.
I also need to move on to the refactoring tasks. I only have 3 days left on the project and i need to make sure each component is as tight asd can be. There are quite a few areas that need tightening up - like testings fancyboxcy with teh new gallery component etc.


Next Task :
- [ ] Docs for undocumented components
