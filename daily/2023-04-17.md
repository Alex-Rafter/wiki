This week is about :
There are lots of smaller / unfinished bits to wrap up before doing anything else i'd say. Then it would also be good to ship something new and useful as well as the tune ups. Maybe a beta of the form to css vars stuff.
Getting the wessex site wrapped up. Amends etc
Supporting on builds with roll out of BSK-Els
Updating shortlist - inc speak with Callum on this
Cognition finish plan and time estimate as prio
Working bsk-els next round - what does this look like? headers and footers? non-custom els stuff?

## Next Task
