## Notes

## Wessex feedback
- Issues with line height 1.8 - eg on banners this doesn't match the concept? : go over explicit (useful) vs calculation (not needed)
- Most useful styleguide stuff
all 3 border radii (sm, normal, lg)
box shadows normal and sm
all 3 line heights (sm, normal, lg)
which is the base spacer for calcs outside of spacer utils - eg spacer is used in other places (and divisions / multipliers of it)
spacers - go smaller than the 10px as the smallest step in the design - we need these down to 2.5px or smilar to get close to bs spacers
- CMS components and example :
bg colour in style guide - grey - components - white, but in example, bg-is white?
- Hover states on buttons etc - style guide vs bootstrap set up (do we need custom overrides)
- UCD gallery not good fit for images they have - need to be 16/9 (with some spacing round the sides)
- Web form vs style guide - style guide purpose clarify (devs vs client / cs etc)
-
