This week is about : getting a finished and robust version 1 of the bluesky elements library out there.
Its better that i do this by focusing on a smaller number of well-tested, high quality elements, than it is a ropey larger set. I want it so that anyone who picks it up can use it with confidence. All of the elements need to have docs and these need to be added in to our vitepress docs site for release.

Some bits of what i have done are probably best trimmed away at this point. Maybe for later pick up. But edit it donw and get everything tight first. Make the workflow as simple and understandable as possible for build devs.
