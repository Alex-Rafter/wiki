## Sinc Perf Sprint

Home perf first 

Need to go through all the scripts that might be affected after the jquery changes and add dom loaded etc
After that we need 

### Actions 
- Write testing notes on what we need to test and look for
- Get testing times with temp pauses 
- Write up interim report




### Testing Notes

The perf sprint work includes changes to many core files. 
This include scripts and styles that are included on every page of the site, and scripts and styles on individual pages.

-  We are specifically comparing live against dev (or uat)
- We are just looking to see f there are differences in behaviour / interactivity or styles between the two
- If you find problems on live, or problems on both dev and live then these need briefing as separate jobs as they are not related to the sprint work
- If you find a bug ONLY on dev (or uat when we're testing there) that would be something to note down as a potential issue from the sprint work
  
- Do navs, burgers, dropdowns, tabs, modals, sliders, etc work as they do on live? 
- Do the pages look the same - are there any differences in styles / styles not being applied as they are on live? 
- Do any other things not work as expected?

## Sinc Next Steps

- Test out changes for home pages and iron out as many problems as poss - this as prio 1
- List out any unfixable stuff - eg Cogcast
- why are scores all over the shop? test without TS
