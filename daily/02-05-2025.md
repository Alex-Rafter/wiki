Okay, i really pushed it this week. 
Its left me both v v happy that i managed to solve the passing reactive data to a nested BSK template but also aware that that problem took loads longer to solve that i had thought it would. 
So, now there is no chance i will finish stuff prod ready this sprint :(
That is a learning for me. 
But at the same time. the stuff i ended up covering is *exactly* what this sprint was about.

What happened then? 
There was an issue i had not forseen that took a long time to solve in a clean way.
So, a good principle for sticking to the sprint 3 as deadline for prod ready initial codebase is: 
only work through the validated areas now. No brand new stuff.

only work through the validated areas now. No brand new stuff

What do i need to do next? 

Basically the main next things are : 
marketing / comms on what i've done so far - 
This should be polished and clear.

sprint summary
full report / pres slides etc 
demos for pres

tidy up what is there 
make a clear plan for sprint 3 - 
exactly what i am going to do, what 'done' looks like for end of sprint 3. And what is not on that plan.
