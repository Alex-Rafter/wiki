Today is about :
Getting most of the basic outline in for most of the pages (in static at least). That should be mostly there now. Just a few additions on ucd maybe - but not much.
After that, it should be about prio'ing the actual tasks for the week : master cms page, home page actual refinined, and the bs variables and assets set up properly.
