Today is about :
Getting most of the basic outline in for most of the pages (in static at least). That should be mostly there now. Just a few additions on ucd maybe - but not much.
After that, it should be about prio'ing the actual tasks for the week :
- home page actual refinined
- master cms page
- and the bs variables and assets set up properly.

## Next task :
  - [ ] BS variables

## Tasks :
- [x] finish rough components
  - [x] UCD contact strip
- [ ] BS variables
- [ ] Assets set up properly
  - [ ] Fonts
  - [ ] Images exported and uploaded to media folder
- [ ] home page components refinined
- [ ] master cms page

##Notes
Scripting design to bs variables definitley possible. At least making my version of the xd file first from the design vars should be doable. Get Kate and Rach to input into form and then can script from there.

Most useful styleguide stuff
all 3 border radii (sm, normal, lg)
box shadows normal and sm
all 3 line heights (sm, normal, lg)
