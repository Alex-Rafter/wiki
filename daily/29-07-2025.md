## Catch Up with Barbs 

### Review 
BP Static - Natalia doing v well. New process much better for her (longer upfront of brief)

### Issues

1. BP Static - Schedule not reflective of reality of time spent
Need to look at what we're trying to ship

2. Sinc : 
Perf - Blocked
BCA - Issues with progressing - testing and code quality

Sinc Issues cont: 
Issues with testing - not sure the team is 
Not using dev + uat

3. High value large clients 
Where process seems to most drop off. 

4. Time conflicts 
What is most important - new world or these dev ops level bits? 

### Prob Solving

BP Static - rev and schedule sprints?
Sinc: with Oli to wrap up 


High value large clients - where process seems to most drop off. 
Specific work with devs and AMs to get process to the best state. 


## Prios 

Manage time : 
- Sinc Perf - get this over the line
- BP Static - get BP 2.0





## BP Static Review 


Interim Goal: 
MVP Boilerplate 2.0 
Enough to build a small site 
Focused on Dev Ex initially

Objectives 
Bring over BSK inc with new slider dep
Enhance BSK with GSAP  (GSAP custom directive?)
Add new components (what are these?)

Refactor codebase so all components are organised properly
Page / partials templates for key page types
Hook all code up to data sources 
Refactor with data sources integrated
Refactor data fetch to work with tech's interim endpoint work
Documentation round 2 inc how to bring over BSK


Milestones 
- Existing BSK brought over and updated to use new deps, and enhanced with GSAP etc 
- New components added to the set
- Page templates set up for all key pages types - using the BSK UI lib
- Full static example pages for all key page types (minus search)
- All components hooked up to a matching cms / cog data source 
- Fully dynamic example pages for all key page types using cog and cms data sources (minus search)

At this point we are ready to start to build - albeit with missing functionality / probs to solve along the way of build 1 (early beta)
