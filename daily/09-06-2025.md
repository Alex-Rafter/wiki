## Week Plan

## BP Static

Need to focus first on re-planning step 3 of BP Static to have devs on for 1 week.

First before anything else: 

### Outstanding Stuff

Finish outstanding data stuff -
- merge (DX) changes
- NCD json
- modular dispatch worker
- testing 2 new transform methods,
- repo readme


### Step 3 Stuff

Goal of Step 3 : 
BP Looks good by default
HQ tested UI Kit with a mix of upgraded and new components
Onboarding process and materials nailed down so its easy to bring people on board

Finished UI Kit 
- Upgraded existing components
- Added new components
HQ Example pages


Build out of BP 2.0
- UI Kit
- Page Templates
- Example pages

Better BP defaults in variables - copy from XD file
Bring over existing component lib
Add additional transitions and animations to existing components
Build out example homepage

Others trained to use BP Static basics
- Onboarded
- Able to work locally
- Able to create static and dynamic content

x

Validating with a homepage 
Onboarding others - docs, vids, briefs ready to go 
UI kit task / phase 

Step 3 Planning and Prep Work

What does step 3 look like?
Me building out UI
Others coming on for a week at a time

What needs to happen for that to be successful?

Reputation API 

- Focus on dispatch store + dispatch worker pattern
- Make that generic and productised from the start
- UI specific to JCT
