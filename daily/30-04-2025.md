I am getting v far but i have important stuff to finish off before the end of this second sprint.
I need to get the BE data load stuff refactored. Its like a day of work - or i could fit it to a day anyway. That leaves a day for FE service and global store stuff with a good example. ANd then one day for tidy ups, report write ups, early docs, and pres demos all sorted.

Today: 
Global state and data load service web worker
Just those 2 things to finish front of the front work completely
Is that all? Yeah pretty much. That is good to go then i'd say.

Pull out components to check global state works with all.
Then move that same pattern to careers / news or something to test with another data source

Tomorrow:
The back of the front refactoring. 
Can i fit it to a day? Yeah im pretty sure i can tbh. Maybe without sorting the new cars data load. That might need extra time i'm not sure.
But everything else i should be able to refactor in a day i think. At least it will be signifcantly improved and ready for a v1.0.

Fri:
Just small tidy ups: merge all the work into main, tidy up branches, etc.
report write ups,
and pres demos
early docs? This might need to be sprint 3 tbh.
