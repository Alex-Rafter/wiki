## New World Sprint 1: 

Landing the project: 
I need to think now in terms of winding things up. 
Better to cut scope and finish with stuff robust and ready to go, rather than unfinished. Think about the Agile book. 

Need to factor time in for Lauren's questions.
Have i done everything i thought i would? 

Code 

- Finish Data load API
- Example filtering?
- Demos to show of pulling this data in and showing on the front end
- GitHub Actions workflows set up to trigger these script runs on POST.
- Additional GitHub Actions workflows set up to send the POST req eg on schedule or workflow dispatch (to mimic any future Tech webhook), etc

Non-Code

- Report on what i've done with demos.
- Docs for all new code - even if bare-bones
- Any gaps identified eg for future Tech work we might need etc.
- Additional notes on API spec for Tech requirements


Report  / Demo Features:
