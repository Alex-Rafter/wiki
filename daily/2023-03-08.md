Notes

## Suggestion for Approach to teh Cognition FE DEV work

Issues :
- Some initial work needed on style guide -> BS variables
- Set up needs to be flexible so as to accomodate changes as Cognition is built out
- Codebase likley needs to be worked via Visual Studio.

Poss Solution :
- Focus on static html build out of components first
- These then handed over for intergration into teh Razor pages / partials

Poss benefits :
- Speed - no set up issues with gettign fe dev set up with Visual Studio
- Sepearets out work bewteen fe and tech
- Static html will be v easily shareable - either on dev site r as embedds so that these can be discussed prior to intergration
