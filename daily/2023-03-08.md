Notes

## Suggestion for Approach to the Cognition FE DEV work

Issues :
- Some initial work needed on style guide -> BS variables
- Set up needs to be flexible so as to accommodate changes as Cognition is built out
- Codebase likely needs to be worked via Visual Studio.

Poss Solution :
- Focus on static html build out of components first
- These then handed over for integration into the Razor pages / partials

Poss benefits :
- Speed - no set up issues with getting fe set up with Visual Studio
- Separates out work between fe and tech - no issues then of working the codebase
- Static html will be v easily shareable - either on dev site or as live embeds so that these can be interacted with by team / and discussed prior to integration
