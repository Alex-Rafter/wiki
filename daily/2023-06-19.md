Today is all about getting prepped for the demo. I want to be able to meet the goal of building out a home page in 30 mins. Its a great
test! Secondary to that will be explaining the components and how they work etc.

To do that : I need to get the assets from Kate.

Today then is about pulling out assets and test building all the home page components for the demo. Thats the main thing. I want the components to be semi-built out, or at leats know they are doable and i have the right ones at hand tomorrow.

I also need to move on Horizon.

## Tasks

Get xd / assets from Kate
Pull out all the assets for each component
Set up branch with current changes for the demo
