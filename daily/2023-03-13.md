Goal notes :
Today is about completing the v.02 release with notes. That means - a push to main branch of all the latest and notes to share on the bsk channel.
I need to get the web scarping brief to Tom today, and get in touch with Hannah as well re: SEO side.
Beyond these smaller things, i need to give a strong focus to the next component batch. I have a few things left on current one which need doing also - like video on slider banner.
I can make good use form this point on of taking styles from exisiting components on recent builds, and then refactoring.
Bang out small things first tnen concentrate on components.
