Goal notes :
Today is about completing the v.02 release with notes. That means - a push to main branch of all the latest and notes to share on the bsk channel.
I need to get the web scarping brief to Tom today, and get in touch with Hannah as well re: SEO side.
Beyoind these smaller things, i need to give a strong focus to the next component batch. I have a few things left on current one which need doing also - like video on slider banner.
I can make good use form this point on of taking styles from exisiting components on recent builds, and then refactoring.
Bang out small things first tnen concentrate on components.

- release notes for v.02
- push from ar-test and bring into main
- web scarping brief draft to Tom and Tony
- contact Hannah re: SEO
- Component work - styles / static, then component logic
  - video slide
  - ucd galleries and variants
  - why choose us spots



## Release Notes v.02

Here are the highlights of the latest release :
- ### Bluseky Elements CLI tool + docs
  - 2 way sync between bluesky elements repo and build. Pull the latest verison of elements into a build, push any edited components back to a special branch on bluesky-elements for feeding back in to the repo.
  - prevent naming duplications when making new components with by listing all elements in a build.
  - rapid component creation from your clipboard. With this you can simly copy any code block and the cli tool will automatically create a new component file in the correct directory, and add the include you need to your build.
  - Here is the [location for the docs](https://github.com/Alex-Rafter/wiki/blob/main/bluesky-elements-docs.md) until all is intergrated into the Vitepress docs site :

- ### New Components
  - Offers cards
