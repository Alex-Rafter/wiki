Today is about : build speed work. Martin is in the office also, good to get testing / feedback on footer dev work.
I am limited in terms of header nav stuff right now. But i can complete some of the project still. I can do top nav and header and use the slots approach to make a defined space for the header-navs.

I have some recurring tasks and it would be good to have these in for a scheduled time each day: CU board maintanance and TIL time daily. Creating a schedule with routined time slots would be good.

## Tasks
- [ ] Form fields
  - [ ] Change default margin bottom and move to testing
  - [ ] component wrapper?
- [ ] OPening Hours
- [ ] Footer dev work
    - [ ] Chase UI testing
- [ ] Header

- [ ] Chase PRs
- [ ] CU Board flow mermaid diagram inc tagging and prio flags after assess
- [ ] Speak with Tom B on header designs as blocks to component dev
