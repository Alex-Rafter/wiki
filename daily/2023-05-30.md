Today is about : build speed work. Martin is in the office also, good to get testing / feedback on footer dev work.
I am limited in terms of header nav stuff right now. But i can complete some of the project still. I can do top nav and header and use the slots approach to make a defined space for the header-navs.

I have some recurring tasks and it would be good to have these in for a scheduled time each day. Creating a schedule with routined time slots would be good.
