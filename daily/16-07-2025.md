Sinc go live issue 

So, what happened? 
After the big changes i'd made, there were merge conflicts on dev between Oli's BCA job and mine
This stopped him working and so i brought over some of his changes when i tried to resolve this to unblock him but i needed to do this in a different way
Oli's valuation work, and the TS changes we already on dev so that makes sense we didn't catch them there 
I don't think the changes were on UAT though ahead of my deploy there on Fri
So i think we have missed those issues when testing UAT. We can see this also with : 
- The group valuation is missing fields marking it as tested on the spreadsheet
- With the TS one, i think we can see the incorrect changes are present on UAT in prev screenshots in this chat from Fri
We didn't pick this up in PR - but the PR was absolutely massive so that makes sense tbh

What we need to do: 

- Reset UAT to match the live site (i'll do this) - 
  Important point here is any work on UAT for testing but not on live will be gone and will need to be re-deployed (this will need to sit with CS and FE Devs on those jobs)
- Pull out only the changes we need for the perf work now on a new branch (i'll do this)
- Bring those over and test on UAT (i'll do this)
- Bring in UAT testing for every job on Sinclair as we do with other sites if we're not doing that? (any devs working the site from here + CS)
  


Please use UAT 

So, in essecne we had an issue arising from tryign to work the perf job alongside the otehr open jobs (probably a leanring that we do actually need a )
We missed in testing on UAT 


What we need 

Put loads of work that shouldn't have gone live on live inc: 



BCA Valuation
Tiny Search amends

Why? 
Given we did extensive testing - why didn't we find this on dev or uat?



Possibles: 

we missed in in testing 

investigation

- I definitely checked out from main so those dev changes should not have been in my branch
115c7f25 (tag: v1.1.0) HEAD@{270}: checkout: moving from main to perf/homepage-lcp

- I had an auto update run by ESET endpoint security that updated my git version today

valuation/default.aspx

- merged Oli's work in after merge conflicts - instead of merging in main -July 10th between 1.23pm - 1.56pm
- deployed to uat 2pm Fri
- no testing on uat? looking at spreadsheet the fields aren't completed for group valuation

TS 



issues
mabbs has reverted back to an older tag - mine after first perf 
the numebrs need to bump upwards at all times
