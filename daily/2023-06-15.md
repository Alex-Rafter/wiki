Today is about : getting ready for Tues demo. Thats the main main thing for today and Mon.
Biggest wins for that?
- Get the new home components styled a bit more so i can drop them in to show easily.
- Get the val town to css vars working with more areas of the sass variables so it updates more stuff and test in use ready to go. It would be great if i can swap out 2 stes of styles.
