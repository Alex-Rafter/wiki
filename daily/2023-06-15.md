Today is about : getting ready for Tues demo. Thats the main main thing for today and Mon.
Biggest wins for that?
- Get the new home components styled a bit more so i can drop them in to show easily.
- Get the val town to css vars working with more areas of the sass variables so it updates more stuff and test in use ready to go. It would be great if i can swap out 2 sets of styles in the demo that would be wicked.
- preppring assets from the demo build - like i would on a day 1 build would be great.
- Maybe i should make a repo for the demo build and point it to my demo site?


Main things to build yet
val to css vars
header nav
Our locations / opening hours component
