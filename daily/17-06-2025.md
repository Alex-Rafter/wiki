Review

What i found hard: 
- No design for the sections - too much of a blank slate
- Need some examples to work from


Discussed issues with brief not clear enough re: not using data 
could have provided more examples and links to current BP eg vehicle card varuations

-- 
Choose the header and vehicle card that you want and tell me

Header Nav - Default with Top Nav
Vehicle Card - 3 - pills with specs

Natalia - start with Hero
