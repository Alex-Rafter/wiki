## Sinc Go Live 


The whole of my branch is corrupted by other stuff being brought over and i have no idea really how that has happened. 

I think the safest thing to do is : 

- reset UAT branch
- create new branch / new branches for the lcp work 
- bring over the changes with git co bit by bit or re-do them bit by bit
