## Perf - Sinclair Sprint


Okay, so i have a really clear idea of what i need to focus on : 
the biggest problem areas: LCP first and foremost

Address this first and test: 

Tasks 
X Fallback content on first load
X JQuery with defer attr

BSK 2.0 and split out 

X CSS Purge? 
Test and review impact on scores


CSS Purge - review and go over otehr plugins 
fancybox etc and see if we need to add these back in too
(vendor css - maybe exclude this?)
