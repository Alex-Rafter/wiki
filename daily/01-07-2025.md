## BP Static - Catch up With Oli

Issue: Oli wanted to go away and have a go after reading docs. This didn't work so well and he needed more input at that point. 

### Review and Issues
BSK - setting it up as an issue
Using examples in docs for reference but unable to do this effectively
### For today 
Do a full walkthrough of codebase, of using stuff, of components, etc 

### Todos 

Need to better plan what the first days on sprint look like 
Need to cover codebase walkthrough on day 1

Web Design Workflow 

Source designs 
Crop images to only those components
Feed into ChatGPT and ask it do: "Describe what you see in this image. Describe each part clearly"
Then ask it to: "Create a brief for an LLM so that it has enough context to build this hero section exactly"
Then, feed that brief into Copilot Agent mode with Claude
Tweak and refine from there
Very rapid workflow to drafts
