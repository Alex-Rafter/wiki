Today is about : Mainly focused on wessex amends. It would be good to ship something else for bsk-els. A good win would be to test new sl-heart with hypes. If i can ship that working that would be a great win. Another smaller item that would make a differetn would be the preview details.
Work through all the wessex amaneds, and do a thorough testing of all forms and email responders on the site.

Also ongoing build support.
