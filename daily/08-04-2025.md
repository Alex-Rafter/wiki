## BP Static: Data Loading

High level patterns : 

Copy CMS for each class we are fetching data for - match these closely where poss

Ordering 
Order by - create a pattern for this that can be applied consistently to all data load APIs
Order by : 
alphabetical - asc and desc
price
location
etc

Ordering (COG)
ShowPOACarsAtBottom
OrderBy - then you set the field to order by eg 
OrderBy="MPG"
OrderByDirection="DESC"

Can i replicate these?


Querying/ Filtering
Include and exclude filters?
Match categories? 

HardCodedQuery +  HardCodedQueryWithQueryString
Can i replicate these somehow? Do i need to? 

GetCount?

Easier to spend the time making a clear interface to query / filter by rather than re-implementing all those properties on COG repeaters. 

Uniform API design over ease: 
Consistency / uniformity as a key principle to the API design


Tasks : 
- Copy CMS for each class we are fetching data for - match these closely where poss
- Ordering API for each. Can this same helper to used for everything? Recursive find of property?
- HardCodedQuery +  HardCodedQueryWithQueryString - replicate?
- Querying/ Filtering with Include and exclude filters?
