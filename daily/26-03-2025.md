Change to this file was the issue.
When deployed to dev pages errored.

Problem was: Control Id="ParasolTracking" was duplicated on other places in coebase and that caused the error.


Cleared them up and dev and uat.

What was the fix? Unsure need to ask Martin.

Problem: when we put it live, checked prematurely.

Didn't communicate with Martin on it.

Duplicate Parasol Control

<COG:ParasolTracking ID="ParasolTracking" runat="server" />

I'm still not 100% sure if this duplicate was in the codebase and tracked by git or if it was on the server only outside of git (ie manually pushed version)
