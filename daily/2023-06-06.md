# 06-06-23

Today is about dnd and bsk-els tasks. I want to get the bp refactor at a place i can say its 'done' for round 1? That would be a really good goal but maybe a bit ambitious. Maybe by end of tomorrow that is more realistic.

## Tasks
Msg on bp ideas
Msg ellie
get dnd on all day
Break down the bp refactor into sub-tasks for today and tomorrow

## BP Refactor Sub Tasks
Add in footer?
Add in spots as tiles on home - harvest these.
Go through all home page components and style better.
Debug spots strip resize slick
Sort the fallback for the banner on mob
Add in the resp img sizes to the banners - give the defaults for px dimensions etc
Add in the examples folder

## Notes

Hey dudes, right now i'm adding a bunch of new stuff to bsk-els. One of the current round of tasks is the footer and the site header. As part of this i've added in a way to use named slots with the lib, This opens up a lot of possibilities for nesting your own html, and using cms grid data, inside components. The footer is at ui testing stage with Kate rn but you can see an example of where we're at so far

We have code review stage after ui testing in the sprint board here, so was planning to get everyone's input on the code at that stage but now seems better time to show it :)

We have a more developed flow for getting bsk-els worked now.
The backlog for bsk-els and build speed stuff more generally is here

There are a whole bunch of other new components and improvements that i will demo properly when we meet on the 20th. But you can also see the backlog and the sprint board here.
