Okay, so its the last full day on this. The focus is purely on quality. No more new stuff - except adding in that bsk to base layout. That's literally it.

Then, go through and : 
tidy ups first 
refactors second
code review key files / classes next
only then look at renamings and adding other methods etc

Anything else will have to wait. 
The only major outstanding thing is the getting the other new cars. But that will have to wait.
