Today is about : getting the footer as far along as poss. Ideally get static versions of at least 3 versions of the footer in draft.
I need to sort out the clikcup board more. This might be an ongoing task rather than something to 'finish' today.


## Notes
- clickup forms and clickup rest api - make a poss alt to using val town for holding css vars data.
