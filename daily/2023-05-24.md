Today is about : getting the footer as far along as poss. Ideally get static versions of at least 3 versions of the footer in draft.
I need to sort out the clikcup board more. This might be an ongoing task rather than something to 'finish' today. It needs regulary maintanenace. Perhaps split time, bigger chunk daily for now until its right, then bit less for daily maintanence.

### Sub Actions
- [ ] Query font size with Kate
- [x] Query spacings for BP
- [ ] Alignment queries
