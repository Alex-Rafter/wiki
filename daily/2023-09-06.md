Today us about :
Visibilty : Updates on UCD and vehicle details more generally.
Sort Kate out list of bsk els not in master ste so as to stop any blockers - what about ucd in this context?
Would be really good if i could ship the updated version of the nav etc so its easy to Tom and Kate to see all components etc now.
Getting Callum set up on the BSK tasks - briefing this will help him, inc when i'm off over Thurs and Fri.
Getting UCD pages and all component variations into BP. To do this i need to make sure they are robust, eg gallery working with video etc.

## Tom B Update

Vehicle details is v far along now. A fair few on the ones i've built out for ucd are generalisable to ncd and ucd.
This, along with thing like the offers cards we already have, means we have a big chunk of ncd already done too so we have a nice head start on this.
So as of now we are looking a bit ahead of that end of next week target for both vehicle details pages done. Probably end of Mon/ sometime Tues details will be in BP main i think.

Callum is joining on bsk stuff today (boom!)
Plan is to initially set Callum up on the stuff that isn't shared by both ucd and ncd, - so like CAP repeater, and range section of ncd and then we review.


## For Callum

NCD
CAP Repeater
Range Section
Offers Carousel -
For the cards we can use existing bsk
For the component, can we look at patterns that we are in use on builds - eg

UCD
