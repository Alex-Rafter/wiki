Today us about :
Visibilty : Updates on UCD and vehicle details more generally.
Sort Kate out list of bsk els not in master ste so as to stop any blockers - what about ucd in this context?
Would be really good if i could ship the updated version of the nav etc so its easy to Tom and Kate to see all components etc now.
Getting Callum set up on the BSK tasks - briefing this will help him, inc when i'm off over Thurs and Fri.
Getting UCD pages and all component variations into BP. To do this i need to make sure they are robust, eg gallery working with video etc.

## Tom B Update
Callum is joining on bsk stuff tiday. Vehicle details is v far along now. Pkan is to initally set Callum up on stuff that isn't covered in the components shared by both ucd and ncd - so like CAP reepater, and range section of ncd.

## For Callum

NCD
CAP Repeater
Range Section
Offers Carousel -
For the cards we can use existing bsk
For the component, can we look at patterns that we are in use.
