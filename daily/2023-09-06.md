Today us about :
Visibilty : Updates on UCD and vehicle details more generally.
Sort Kate out list of bsk els not in master ste so as to stop any blockers - what about ucd in this context?
Would be really good if i could ship the updated version of the nav etc so its easy to Tom and Kate to see all components etc now.
Getting Callum set up on the BSK tasks - briefing this will help him, inc when i'm off over Thurs and Fri.
Getting UCD pages and all component variations into BP. To do this i need to make sure they are robust, eg gallery working with video etc.
