## Overview

Today is about building. Its about not getting distracted by dms etc and actually getting components done. Weds will be v broken so todya and Thurs v important.

MIT :
Get new components added in to the set!

Next task :
- [ ] Bring all work on ar-test into BSK repo

## Tasks
- [x] Bring all work on ar-test into BSK repo
- [ ] Offers components
- [ ] Hero Banners (not video)
- [ ] Refactor existing
- [ ] Web Scraping Brief
- [x] Follow up with Kate

## Notes

How to bring work over from ar-test to BSK repo?
- Pushes to that repo but only the needed files...
    - new branch that links with sync branch on bsk-els
    - Set up new branch and link to track bks-sync branch
- check a sync repo
- merge only the files needed
- push those to the bsk remote

Didn't i do something like this and it didn't work


NOtes :
BP :
elements list
elements paste
elements push
elements pull


BSK :
elements sync

Process :

## How to add latest components to BP ahead of a PR
First, complete all work on bsk-els repo and raise PR there so they're merged into the main branch
Switch to BP and on your new branch run `npm run elements 'pull'`
This will bring the latest version of the components dirctories from bsk-els into your current BP branch.
Now you can test the latest components on BP, and when you're raise a PR as normal when you're ready to do so.

## How to push changes back from BP to BSK-Els repo
The workflow for component development is work on bsk-els repo, then bring the changes into BP to test them.
But, if, for whatever reason, you needed to make an edit to a component or its logic while you're working on BP you can still push those changes back to bsk-els repo.
You can do that and run `npm run elements 'push'`
This will push the changes from BP to the bsk-els repo in a special 'sync' branch, ready for testing and merging into the main branch there.

## How to check what all the component names are
Before you make a new component, you might need to check what the names of all the existing components are.
You can run `npm run elements 'list'` to get a list of all the component names in the terminal.

## How to quickly turn a snippet of code into a component
Its likley that i you're working on a build you will end up writing code that would be a good case for re-use but that isn't coevred in the core component library. For example, a spotlight that is used in various places on the site.
You can quickly turn any snippet of code wrapped in a template tag into a component by running `npm run elements 'paste'`.
This will automatically add your snippet into the correct directory , ready for use.
All you then need to do is use the custiome html tag that matches the name of the component you just created .e.g
for a spotlight snippet wrapped in a template tag like this
`<template bsk-els=bsk-spotlight"><spotlight></spotlight></template>`
you would

`<spotlight></spotlight>`

If you have a snippet of code that you want to turn into a component for re-use on a build for example, you can run `npm run elements 'paste'` and paste the code into the terminal.


Then you can run npm run elements 'sync'
Then you can run npm run elements 'pull' to pull the changes into the bsk repo
Then you can run npm run elements 'sync' to sync the changes to the bsk-sync repo
