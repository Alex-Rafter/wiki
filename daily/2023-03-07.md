## Notes

How to bring work over from ar-test to BSK repo?
- Pushes to that repo but only the needed files...
    - new branch that links with sync branch on bluesky-elements
    - Set up new branch and link to track bks-sync branch
- check a sync repo
- merge only the files needed
- push those to the bsk remote

Didn't i do something like this and it didn't wor

<hr/>

Places where components are less good :
offers - are we duplicating the work that is being done? Losing control? Reinventing the wheel here? Eg json parse from kv pairs in inline offers finance data.


For tomorrow :
Find sites that have stuff like the master components
Build out quickly on static site. Even without template logic - just static first.
Then add template logic to a bunch of them
