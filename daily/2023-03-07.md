## Notes

How to bring work over from ar-test to BSK repo?
- Pushes to that repo but only the needed files...
    - new branch that links with sync branch on bsk-els
    - Set up new branch and link to track bks-sync branch
- check a sync repo
- merge only the files needed
- push those to the bsk remote

Didn't i do something like this and it didn't work


NOtes :
BP :
elements list
elements paste
elements push
elements pull


BSK :
elements sync

Process :

## How to add latest components to BP ahead of a PR
First, complete all work on bsk-els repo and raise PR there so they're merged into the main branch
Switch to BP and on your new branch run `npm run elements 'pull'`
This will pull the latest version of the components from bsk-els repo main branch into your current BP branch.

## How to push changes back from BP to BSK-Els repo
If, for whatever reason, you run tests on bp and you need to make a quick edit to a component. You can do that and run npm run elements 'push'
This will push the changes from BP to the bsk-els repo


Then you can run npm run elements 'sync'
Then you can run npm run elements 'pull' to pull the changes into the bsk repo
Then you can run npm run elements 'sync' to sync the changes to the bsk-sync repo
