What is today about?
I really want to ship today. Need to get the PR in before 12pm, before meeting.

How do i do that?

Cut it down.
UCD should be doable at this point.
Get the v1,v2,v3, all tidied up
Get v1 in UCD.aspx

For NCD, there is a lot to do still.
What is the smallest thing i can do?
NCD : Get the components that are currently in working.

Get the docs updated for the new components (can do this arvo after PR)
