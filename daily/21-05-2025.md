Today is about: 

last day of code - 
just tidy stuff up
just get it to v.01


sort normalisation across all data
tidy stuff up
sort namings - particualry the newer stuff
use GH CoP Code Review on the important stuff first - main classes etc 


Demos
Sort omni-search demo
bring over the prev demo pages - or make sure they're working at least 
Thats it really

Having another absolute shocker. 
Buggy as fuck. 

Best thing to do? 

Pull out that filter manager into the store. 
Call it from there for each component. 
Don't wrap more bsk than needed. 
Shared logic like this goes in the store. 
Simple.
