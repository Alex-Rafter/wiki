## BP Static : Next Steps / Roadmap


For me, its now about: 
- Quality (testing, improving, refactoring) 
- Docs + Learning materials 
- Comms with other team members on what we're doing etc
- Working group - planning, leading the iterations, supporting, pairing, etc
- DSLs 
- Omni Search - building out the core building blocks 
- CI/CD workflows for new world

Working Group: 
- Test new codebase / validate assumptions re: DX etc
- Build static assets - page and feature level
- Add dynamic data sources with @bsk-data
- Create / feed in a shape DSLs - scopes with custom directives and bs data attrs 
- use omni-search to create filterable / reactive data-driven front end (offers, news)
- HS etc as last

Go live 

Issue : 

swap over means : 
robots not up to date
main branch not up to date - so it is feaibly possible to overritw site 
server dirs in workflow need updating to re-point so this can be an issue
