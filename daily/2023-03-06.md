## Notes

Call with Cal
Thinks Jame's approach was to empahsise.
Not using the calculations inside variables as they currently stand.
Updates the font sizes etc in the variables based on the concept.
Having some type of scale is important.
Will update spacings, font sizes, etc in the variables to match concept.
Don't need to sit with existing calculations - can update rsther than need to stick.


Principles :
the variables are flexible and can be updated to match the concept.
Devs, focus on BS variables file as a key of the build process to  reduce need for overrides and custome styles - speeds up build.

---------
Concerns
---------

Inconsistency on containers
Typeface - still using the default (eg open sans) in places instead of the brand typeface choices.
