## Day Planner

### Goal :
Today is about cleaning up stuff a bit, and clarifying the next steps of the base class project. Some things i need to do are :

- [ ] Sort the git push and pull to BSK Els repo and back to BP / AR Test. Have this locked down
- [ ] Get the updated styles etc that are currently on AR test into BSK Els.
- [ ] Set this up for BP.
- [ ] Clean up the on reload event that should be global but is on card sub-component.
