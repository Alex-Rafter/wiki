BP Static: Filters 


The right way to do this (if at all) is to do a really intelligent (does that mean complex??) casting of types with zod in the filter methods themselves. Maybe even pull this out into one re-usable method on the class itself and call this. Cover all bases here and leave the types alone in the content collection config.

Just get it right once in one place and leave the rest of the code alone. Its for tech to sort the correct types etc at the source i think? Although it would be much more useful to have correctly typed data i think. Maybe just getting rid of tildes for null or empty string?

I think it could be worth sorting the data out a bit tbh. So you can do proper falsy checks etc. 

Anything with "True" or "False" shoukd be cast to boolean. 
Empty strings can probably get away with being empty strings
Tildes need to be consistent with other empty string data - either null or ""
googleMapEmbed and and html1 etc on dealerships all need proper escaping.
