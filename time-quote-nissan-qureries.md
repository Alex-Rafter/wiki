----
Landing Hero + new car page components
----
Is this a hero image or mock up of something we'd need to create in html on bg img etc?
Same q on new sections added on new cars pages etc in brief
Hero mentions animation etc - is this to be over bg img from brief or separate?


----
New Cars List
----

How would the new cars be added to the site?
Are these to be pulled in based on what is in cms? Same for all and non-changing?
What is the data source for these?

----
Last year 2 quotes were done :
1st brief is generic to all the sites.
2nd is for each site, and includes a brief of the specific requirements for each site inc the new cars that would be added for each.

New cars list section would be the same for all the sites in terms of assets and content but each site would select which cars to display.
We could build out all varaints at the start as part of first round of work and then models needed briefed as part of rnd 2.
The assets and content for each new cars would need to be dynamic so it could be updated.
Not all are on cogcms. Some are on surreal cms. So it needs to be either hardcoded or pulled in from 1 source.
Hardcoded would be easier and as its 2 weeks shouldn't need updating.

----

Initial fe dev work was split between all the sites
But the 2nd part is new cars page was only done for the main site.

Assets :
Assets and content will be provided.
Will be the same for all the sites.

-----
Form
-----

Any special requirements for the form?
Does it need to be hooked up to any lead management system?
Is that the same for all or different? Can we create on default form we can roll out to all sites?

Will be the same form as last year or very similar. If different it will be slight difference.
