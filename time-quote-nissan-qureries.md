# Queries from brief :

- Notes from call with Char 29.06.23
- Sam C did quote last year
- Generic template landing page as pt 1 of work
- Then customised for each site (within a few parameters) as pt 2 of work
- Not all sites on same cms (some on cogcms, some on surreal cms)


### Qs: Landing Hero + new car page components

## General Notes

- Is this a hero image or mock up of something we'd need to create in html on bg img etc?
- Same q on new sections added on new cars pages etc in brief
- Hero mentions animation etc - is this to be over bg img from brief or separate?

## Actions
- Char to speak with Nissan on animation
- Alex to speak with Sam C on advice from last year, and on whether to do as 1 or 2 as last year.

#### Answers :

- Last year was simple bg image with html text over.
- Char to speak with Nissan on animation and get back on what's needed.



### Qs: New Cars List

- How would the new cars be added to the site?
- Are these to be pulled in based on what is in cms? Same for all and non-changing?
- What is the data source for these?

#### Answers :

- New cars list section would be the same for all the sites in terms of assets and content but each site would select which cars to display.
- We could build out all varaints at the start as part of first round of work and then models needed briefed as part of rnd 2.
- The assets and content for each new cars would need to be dynamic so it could be updated.
- Not all are on cogcms. Some are on surreal cms. So it needs to be either hardcoded or pulled in from 1 source.
- Hardcoded would be easier and as its 2 weeks shouldn't need updating.

----


- Last year 2 quotes were done :
- 1st brief is generic to all the sites.
- 2nd is for each site, and includes a brief of the specific requirements for each site inc the new cars that would be added for each.
- Initial fe dev work cost was split between all the sites

### Qs: Assets :
- Assets and content will be provided.
- Will be the same for all the sites.
- Copy might change slightly for each site.

### Qs: Form

- Any special requirements for the form?
- Does it need to be hooked up to any lead management system?
- Is that the same for all or different? Can we create on default form we can roll out to all sites?

#### Answers :

- Will be the same form as last year or very similar. If different it will be slight difference.
