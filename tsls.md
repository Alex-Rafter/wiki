Perf Sprint Testing Plan

We plan to break down the perf sprint into smaller chunks so that we can get stuff tested and live without blocking Q3 work for long periods.

Testing Notes

The perf sprint work includes changes to many core files. 
This includes scripts and styles that are included on every page of the site, 
This includes or affects scripts styles on individual pages.

-  We are specifically comparing live against the testing environment (dev or uat)
-  We are just looking to see fi there are differences in behaviour / interactivity or styles between the two versions of the page (live and testing env)
- If you find problems on live then these need briefing as separate jobs as they are not related to the sprint work
- If you find problems problems on both dev and live hen these need briefing as separate jobs as they are not related to the sprint work
- If you find a bug ONLY on the testing env when comparing against live that would be something to note down as a potential issue from the sprint work
