# Bluesky Ideas

:bulb: Collection of ideas for Bluesky Projects

## BS Variables Training Videos

Small snippets of extending / changing the core BS variables e.g

- Spacings
- Utils API
- Theme colours

## Des / Dev Handover Process Review Meeting

- A regular (bi-monthly?) meeting to look at handover issues - how its going in practise with the builds etc
  - Style guide as a key focus as this is proving useful
  - Actions assigned from this e.g style guide tweaks
- And / or g form to get feedback on impiortant issues / probs etc and improvements from fe devs

## Style Guide Improvements

- 80/20 the variables - most impirtant added to style guide
  - Add in border radius for example

## VB Logic clean up
incs dir for template-logic

## Session Object as bigger thing
speak with Dave on any perf implications

## Build speed Up Ideas
- set up wizard (with bash script / shelljs)
    sets up branches,
    urls in readme,
    webpack config

- Scripting design to bs variables definitley possible.
  At least making my version of the xd file first from the design vars should be doable. Get Kate and Rach to input into form and then can script from there.

## Hypes script
- script to integrate hypes into a build - shelljs
- No need to do all the set up manually

## Psyudo Lang for bsk-els
- firebase vid as example to work from?

## CSS Vars in Sass bundle
Pull most useful from bs that aren't css vars into the bundle oursleves (Wessex css-vars.scss as example)


## bsk-els on cdn
A way to pass widgets etc out to legacy sites
Declarative shadow dom?

## Resp designs needed
Used xd / figma resp functionality - not static images

## Vue form forbuild config data - bs vars form test page
Once data is input by ux/ui designers the values could be added to updated sass file of bs vars and then compiled and sent back to the browser
