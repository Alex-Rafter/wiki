COGCMS 

- Talked over issue with building out designed cogcms grid content section. 

Poss solutions : 
Designing to a reduced container 
md breakpoint - issue. Is the fix for this that the tech work needs to be done first to change default breakpoints, rather than a design or fe solution? 

helper classes 
e.g vertically centring, text alignment, button fw or not, reorder-mob, bullet point styles

Could we use this as the master design for cogcms grid. Test robustness of dev work, work solution for md breakpoint issue. 
Then add on helper classes on top of this.

Actions 
- Speak with Rach on Days COGCMS design and input on using as master 
- Speak with fe build devs on that feasibility of using this as master design and adding helper classes on top of this.
- Get feedback on useful helper classes to add to cogcms grid scss.
- Need to flag md- breakpoint issue and whether this is changed first by tech 
- Design tweaks? Or just straight copy to master  cogcms 
- Build out all comoponents and test all possible combinations of cogcms grid.
